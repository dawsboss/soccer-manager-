/* The club's Cloud Functions (GOTSPORT.md, The server).

   Deployed with `firebase deploy --only functions` from the repository root
   (README, "Notifications to a closed phone"). Each export is one job; the
   judgement in each lives in a file of its own that imports nothing from
   Firebase, so test/push.js runs it against the fake database.

   Two rules for everything added here, from CLAUDE.md's Conventions:
   - a function writes with admin credentials and bypasses the rules, so one
     that acts for somebody checks them against the lookup tables the rules
     read, and is tested for every kind of account;
   - nothing at the sideline waits on it. The phone stays offline-first; the
     server does the jobs that belong to nobody in particular.

   Triggers listen on every database instance in the project (the default),
   and read from the instance the event came from, `event.data.ref.root`, so
   a second database for rehearsing rules (firebase-config.js,
   SOCCER_FIREBASE_ENVS) is answered from its own data and its own phones'
   tokens, never the real club's. */
